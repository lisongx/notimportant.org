# Design

I've help design several covers for [Zoomin' Night](https://zoominnight.bandcamp.com/)'s cassette tape releases, as well as concert posters for improvised/experimental music events happened in Beijing.

(Details coming soon……)

If you're interested in hiring me for design works, feel free to contact me at iseansay at gmail dot com.
